# FusedLocationProvider Client

### Overview
Contains the code for building the FusedLocationProvider Client app in Android for fetching GPS data using Google API. This is based from this [Medium](https://medium.com/@ssaurel/getting-gps-location-on-android-with-fused-location-provider-api-1001eb549089) article and I modified it to send the GPS data to Raspberry Pi via TCP.
